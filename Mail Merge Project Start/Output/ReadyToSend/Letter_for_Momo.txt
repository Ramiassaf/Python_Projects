Dear Momo,

I am writing to express my interest in the Data Science Entry Level position that I saw advertised on [website]. I am a recent graduate of Rafik Hariri University with a Bachelor of Engineering in Mechatronics Engineering. I am passionate about using data to solve real-world problems and am eager to learn more about the field.

I have completed several courses in data science, including machine learning, data mining, and data visualization. I am also proficient in Python and R. In addition to my coursework, I have gained experience in data science through my participation in several projects. In my most recent project, I built a bomb disposal robot prototype using Raspberry pi, Arduino Microcontroller and Robot Operating System(ROS). I also developed a Pong Game and a Turtle Car Crossing Game in Python.

I have also completed the following certifications:

Artificial Intelligence Bootcamp Authorized by Zaka 2023
What is Data Science Authorized by IBM Coursera 2023
Tools For Data Science Authorized by IBM Coursera 2023
Machine Learning Authorized by the University of Stanford,2022
I am a highly motivated and results-oriented individual with a strong passion for data science. I am always eager to learn new things and am constantly looking for new ways to apply my skills to solve real-world problems. I am confident that I would be a valuable asset to your team and would be able to make a significant contribution to your company's success.

I have attached my resume for your review and would be happy to answer any questions you may have. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
